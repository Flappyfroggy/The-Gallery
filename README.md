# The-Gallery
The Gallery of Orpheus and Blahaj, A small gallery of artworks featuring Orpheus the hack club mascot and Blahaj, the ikea shark. All of these artworks were hand drawn by me on Procreate, and the Gallery was made on HTML, being my first time using that coding language. The Gallery also features a video version of the artworks showcasing the arworks with smooth transitions, saved as the Orpheus.MP4 file.
